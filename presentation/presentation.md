# Group 3 - Workshop React Native

## Goals

- React Basics
- We Build a Weather App
- Not covered: Testing :(
- Q/A if there's time left

## React Native

- JavaScript (Node.js) to Native (iOS, Android)
- Structured in Components
- Flux Architecture (Observer Pattern)

## Props and State

Components have...

  - Properties , immutable, Note: JavaScript has no immutables! Looks like
    `this.props`
  - State via Store, looks like `this.state`

## Templates via JSX

- Looks like HTML/XML
- Feels like HTML (Styles like CSS)

## Code...

```
$ npm install -g create-react-native-app
$ create-react-native-app weather-app
```
