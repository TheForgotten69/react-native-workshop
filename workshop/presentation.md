# Group 3 - Workshop React Native

## Goals

- React Basics
- We Build a Weather App

## React Native

- JavaScript (Node.js) to Native (iOS, Android)
- Flux Architecture (Observer Pattern)

## Props and State

- Immutable Props (JavaScript has no immutables!)
- State via Store

## Templates via JSX

- Looks like HTML/XML
- Feels like HTML (Styles like CSS)

## Code...

```
$ npm install -g create-react-native-app
$ create-react-native-app demo-weather-app
```
